### Fuzzy Systems
Every day humans use imprecise linguistic terms e.g. big, fast, about 12 o'clock, old, etc.

All complex human actions are decisions based on such concepts:

- driving and parking a car,

- financial/business decisions,

- law and justice,

- giving a lecture,

- listening to the professor/tutor.

So, these terms and the way they are processed play a crucial role.

Computers need a mathematical model to express and process such complex semantics.

Concepts in classical mathematics are inadequate for such models.
